# Database Management Tool Design Document

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose

This document outlines the high-level design for a terminal-based database management tool with TUI, supporting multiple database types, and featuring an embedded language model for query assistance.

## 8. Alternatives Considered

### 8.1 TUI Libraries

a) [github.com/rivo/tview](https://github.com/rivo/tview)

Pros:

- High-level API for complex layouts
- Rich text support
- Extensive widget library

Cons:

- May be overkill for simpler interfaces
- Less fine-grained control

b) [github.com/jroimartin/gocui](https://github.com/jroimartin/gocui)

Pros:

- Low-level, offering fine-grained control
- Lightweight
- Close to traditional ncurses experience

Cons:

- More complex to use for advanced layouts
- Less built-in widgets

c) [github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea) **(chosen)**

Pros:

- Modern, composable architecture
- Growing ecosystem of components
- Elegant handling of state and updates

Cons:

- Different paradigm (Elm-inspired) with potential learning curve
- Relatively newer, may have fewer examples/resources

### 8.2 Database Connectivity

a) Use separate drivers for each database type **(chosen)**

Pros:

- Native performance for each database
- Full access to database-specific features

Cons:

- More code to maintain
- Potential inconsistencies across implementations

b) Use a universal database adapter (e.g., [ODBC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Database_Connectivity))

Pros:

- Single interface for multiple databases
- Potentially easier to add new database support

Cons:

- May not support all database-specific features
- Potential performance overhead
- Limited support for NoSQL databases

### 8.3 LLM Integration

a) Direct integration with [LLaMA-CPP](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp) using [CGo](https://pkg.go.dev/cmd/cgo)

Pros:

- Potentially faster execution
- Tighter integration with Go code

Cons:

- Complicates build process
- Risk of breaking changes affecting Go code

b) Use [LLaMA-CPP](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp)'s HTTP server or CLI **(chosen)**

Pros:

- Cleaner separation of concerns
- Easier to swap out for other models in the future
- Simpler Go code, no CGo required

Cons:

- Slight performance overhead due to HTTP/process communication
- Requires managing a separate process

### 8.4 LLM Training

There just aren't any mature tools available for LLM training in Go, so we're going to go with Python

a) Train in Python using [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) **(chosen)**

Pros:

- Dynamic computation graph: PyTorch builds the computational graph as you execute the code, making it more intuitive and easier to debug. This is particularly useful for research and prototyping, where flexibility and quick iteration are essential.
- Pythonic: PyTorch feels more like native Python code, making it easier to learn and use for those familiar with the language.
- Strong community: PyTorch has a rapidly growing community, especially among researchers, leading to excellent support and a wealth of tutorials and resources.

Cons:

- Scalability: While PyTorch can scale to large datasets and models, TensorFlow might be better optimized for very large-scale deployments.
- Introduces another language to the project

b) Train in Python using [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)

Pros:

- Scalability: TensorFlow is designed for scalability and performance, making it suitable for large-scale applications and production environments.
- Deployment: TensorFlow offers a wide range of deployment options, including TensorFlow Serving, TensorFlow Lite for mobile and embedded devices, and support for various cloud platforms.
- Mature ecosystem: TensorFlow has a larger and more established community, providing extensive resources, documentation, and support.

Cons:

- Static computation graph: TensorFlow traditionally used a static computation graph, which can be less intuitive for debugging and prototyping. However, TensorFlow 2.0 introduced eager execution, bridging the gap with PyTorch's dynamic approach.
- Steeper learning curve: TensorFlow's syntax and structure can be more complex, especially for beginners.
- Introduces another language to the project

### 8.5 Neovim Integration

a) Develop as a native [Neovim](https://neovim.io/) plugin in [Lua](https://neovim.io/doc/user/lua.html) **(chosen)**

Pros:

- Direct access to Neovim API
- Better performance for editor interactions

Cons:

- Not compatible with vanilla [VIM](https://www.vim.org/)

b) Use a generic editor integration approach (e.g., [Language Server Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_Server_Protocol))

Pros:

- Could potentially work with multiple editors
- Standardized protocol

Cons:

- May not be able to leverage Neovim-specific features
- Overhead of LSP may be unnecessary for this use case
